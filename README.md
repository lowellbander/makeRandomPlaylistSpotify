# makeRandomPlaylistSpotify
This is a small and janky python script to take a random sample of a user's library and add it to a playlist. There are somethings you need to do before running the script:
1) make sure you have python 3 and install the module spotipy (https://github.com/plamere/spotipy). 
2) create a spotify playlist on your spotify account, and make sure it is at the top of your playlists. (So where it says playlists in the desktop app the first playlist under the 'playlist' header should be the one you want ot add songs to)
3) run the script from the command line  using the command 'python randomPlaylist.py \<your username\> \<number of songs to add\>', and follow the prompts. you can only add upto a hundred songs at a time. 

Heres a compiled executable for windows, run at the command line same arguments as script
